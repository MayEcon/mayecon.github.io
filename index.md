## About Me

I am an Economics Ph.D. student at University of Minnesota who is on the job market for 2022-2023. I will be available for interviews at the ASSA Meeting in January 2023. My research interests are macroeconomics, firm dynamcis, and inequality. When I am not wading through data, I enjoy cooking, gardening, and snowboarding.


## Working Papers

- **Innovation and Competition Policy**
  <br>
  Job Market Paper
  <br>
  **Abstract:** There is no clear consensus on the impact of mergers and acquisitions on innovation. This makes antitrust policy a challenging balance between fighting monopoly power while minimizing potential negative impacts on economic growth. Using a novel machine learning approach, this paper documents the fraction of M&A activity that is comprised by firms acquiring their direct competitors. Using this evidence, the paper then develops the first structural model with endogenous growth, oligopolistic competition, and endogenous M&A both within a sector and between sectors. M&A activity within a sector allows firms to consolidate a market, while M&A activity between sectors provides firms with the ability to compete in a new market. Both are important incentives in innovation decisions. In contrast to previous studies, this rich structure captures both the major pro- and anti-competitive stories of M&A. The estimated model shows that – under current US antitrust policy – the gains in growth from M&A outweigh the losses arising due to increased monopoly power. However, the degree of increased monopoly power is substantial. This motivates an optimal antitrust policy experiment. The results show that optimal US antitrust policy can decrease monopoly power with only a modest impact on growth

- **On the Nature of Entrepreneurship**

  <br>[Current Draft](Documents/OnTheNatureOfEntrepreneurship.pdf)
  <br>
  **Abstract:** This paper elucidates the nature of entrepreneurship by comparing life-cycle income profiles and outcomes of individuals who share similar characteristics but differ in their choice of self- or paid-employment. Results are based on U.S. administrative data from the Internal Revenue Service and Social Security Administration over the period 2000–2015 for subgroups of the population differing by gender, marital status, education, occupation, industry, cohort, and employment status. Contrary to top-coded survey evidence based on relatively small samples and short panels, we find that entrepreneurs with at least twelve years in self-employment during our sample have significantly higher average income and steeper, more persistent, income growth profiles than their paid-employed peers with similar characteristics. Contrary to survey evidence, we find that new entrants into self-employment have higher labor incomes and lower asset incomes prior to entry relative to similar peers that do not enter. A theory of entrepreneurial choice is developed and compared to the subsample of young entrepreneurs in our data. We find that including firm-specific investment and selection under incomplete information is necessary if the theory is to match the observed income growth profiles and switching behavior for these young entrepreneurs.

## Work In Progress
- **More Data, More Inequality**
  <br>
  **Description**: Firms are spending billions on collecting and processing data about their customers. An important question is how firms are utilizing this data and how it shapes their relationship with their consumers. This project studies how firms can employ data to effectively price discriminate. The initial results are striking. Even under conservative assumptions, an increase in data collection efficiency leads to a substantial increase in asset inequality and a decrease in household welfare.

- **Knowledge Workers**
  <br>
  with: [Ellen McGrattan](http://users.econ.umn.edu/~erm/)
  <br>
  **Description**: Utilizing IRS admistrative data and machine learning, this project measures the labor input of firms' investment in intangible capital. Using machine learning to identify worker types, this project can identify investment for each major type of that invest such as research and development, marketing, software, etc. Between the scope of the data --- every firm in the US --- and this specificity, this will be the most compressive measurement of intangible investments in the US.
