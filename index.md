## About Me

I am an assistant professor at California State University, Fullerton. My research interests are macroeconomics, firm dynamics, and regulatory policy. Additionally, I am actively developing techniques to apply machine learning and big data to macroeconomic questions. When I am not wading through data, I enjoy cooking, gardening, and paragliding.

  <br>
  **Abstract:** This paper elucidates the nature of entrepreneurship by comparing life-cycle income profiles and outcomes of individuals who share similar characteristics but differ in their choice of self- or paid-employment. Results are based on U.S. administrative data from the Internal Revenue Service and Social Security Administration over the period 2000â€“2015 for subgroups of the population differing by gender, marital status, education, occupation, industry, cohort, and employment status. Contrary to top-coded survey evidence based on relatively small samples and short panels, we find that entrepreneurs with at least twelve years in self-employment during our sample have significantly higher average income and steeper, more persistent, income growth profiles than their paid-employed peers with similar characteristics. Contrary to survey evidence, we find that new entrants into self-employment have higher labor incomes and lower asset incomes prior to entry relative to similar peers that do not enter. A theory of entrepreneurial choice is developed and compared to the subsample of young entrepreneurs in our data. We find that including firm-specific investment and selection under incomplete information is necessary if the theory is to match the observed income growth profiles and switching behavior for these young entrepreneurs.

- **Antitrust Policy and Economic Growth**<br>
  **Abstract:** It has become increasingly apparent to policymakers that optimal antitrust policy re- quires looking beyond traditional static analyses and considering the dynamic effects of policy. Such analysis is challenging as limited studies exist concerning dynamic compe- tition policy. This paper attempts to bridge this knowledge gap by developing a novel structural growth model containing the major motivations of mergers and acquisitions (M&A) activity. To enable estimation of the model, frontier natural language processing (NLP) techniques are employed to classify whether parties to an M&A transaction are currently operating in similar markets or whether acquirers are using M&A as an entry mechanism into new markets. Examining the overall impact of M&A on growth reveals a double-edged sword: policies that either completely shut down M&A or allow unre- stricted M&A both result in significantly lower growth rates than the baseline estimate. This motivates an optimal antitrust policy that accounts for dynamic effects.

- **Using Machine Learning to Classify M&A Transaction**<br>
  **Abstract:** This paper develops a novel methodology for classifying relationships between parties in a merger and acquisition transaction. Understanding the motives of an M&A transaction is essential in researching the economic impact of M&A. Given the high number of transactions per year, manually classifying every transaction is unfeasible. This paper proposes a novel methodology using a large-language model to determine if a transaction has possible horizontal or vertical linkages. With sufficient information, this model is highly accurate. Focusing on transactions involving U.S. firms, 38% of transactions were only horizontally linked, 38% were only vertically linked, 12% were both horizontally and vertically linked, and 10% had no linkages. This pattern is robust across time and presidential administrations. The resulting data can be used by any researcher studying M&A transactions.
